    "In this practical, we will analyse data from a fitness tracking app. The data have been collected from various different users and stored in a single file. The data are a mixture of user profile data (username, date of birth, etc.) and activity records (swim distance, etc.). This means the profile data are repeated for every user for every activity they recorded. That is not very useful!\n",

    "Worse, the columns are not appropriate for all activities. For example, the column `stroke` only has data when the user was swimming, otherwise it is empty.\n",
